### Description of the project on Skyroot Website Clone which was developed by you using HTML & CSS:

The Skyroot Website Clone project is a recreation of the website for Skyroot Aerospace, an Indian aerospace company that is developing small launch vehicles. The project was developed using HTML and CSS only. This means that the website is static and does not interact with users in real time. However, the website can still display information and images, and it can still be navigated by users.

The project was developed in two phases. 
In the first phase, I designed the website's user interface, created a wireframe of the website, and then implemented the wireframe using HTML.
In the second phase, I styled the website using CSS and used CSS to control the layout of the website, the colors, and the fonts.

The project was completed in a few weeks. I used a variety of resources to learn HTML and CSS. I read books, watched tutorials, and practiced coding.

The project was a valuable learning experience for me. I gained experience in web development, HTML, and CSS. I also learned about the aerospace industry and the challenges of launching small launch vehicles.

The project was also a way for me to contribute to the Indian aerospace industry. I helped to create a website that promoted Skyroot Aerospace and its mission. I also assisted in raising awareness of the aerospace industry in India.

Here are some of the specific tasks that I completed:

- Designed the website's user interface using a wireframe.
- Implemented the wireframe using HTML.
- Styled the website using CSS.
- Integrated the website with Skyroot Aerospace's logo and branding.
- Tested the website for bugs and errors.
